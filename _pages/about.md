Hi! I'm Frances Elliott. I teach private Alexander Technique lessons in the Northeast Heights area of Albuquerque. I graduated from the Alexander Technique Center of Albuquerque in early 2025.  

After years of chronic pain and trying everything under the sun, the Alexander Technique was the only modality that truly catalyzed change for me. I was first introduced to the A.T. as a music major at Yale University.  I was bowled over by how my flute tone and musicality instantly improved under the hands of my A.T. teacher. Years later, joining an AMSAT-certified teacher training course resolved my chronic hip pain post hip surgery, when dozens of other traditional and alternative modalities had failed to make a dent in my pain.

I see the A.T. as a gateway to freedom, not just in relationship to pain, but to all facets of life. The implications are deep and can take years to unfold, but the experience of a hands-on lesson is immediate, concrete, and unlike anything you've had before.
